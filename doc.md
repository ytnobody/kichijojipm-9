## What is the VSCode?

Visual Studio Code

[http://code.visualstudio.com/](http://code.visualstudio.com/)

* From Microsoft Corp.
* Version 1.7 is the newest. (in 2016-11-15)
* [The source code is available under the MIT license agreement.](http://code.visualstudio.com/License)
* Is not a full-stack IDE. A code editor that integrated with the tarminal.

---

## Why use it?

VSCode is ...

* the Vim.
* and the Emacs.
* and the Mega-customizable editor.
* and it is Git friendly.
* and it supports MacOS / Windows and Linux.
* and ... it is very fast and lightweight. 

I still bit use the Vim for some traditional system.

But, VSCode is the better-Vim for me.

---

## Why VSCode is the better-Vim?

Because, the [VSCodeVim/Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) extension is there.

---

## Why VSCode is the Emacs...?

Because, the [nisheetjain/vscode-emacs](https://github.com/nisheetjain/vscode-emacs) extension is there, And more.
